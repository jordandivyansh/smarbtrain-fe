# Getting Started with Create React App


This React web application is designed to identify faces from image URLs while offering user registration and sign-in functionalities. Each user gains access to an individual profile, tracking the count of image URL submissions.

Frontend:

Developed using React.js, featuring a responsive web design with reusable components such as Navigation, Register, Login, and Image Recognition Box.
Leverages key React concepts including props, state management, life-cycle management, event handling, conditional rendering, form implementation, and error handling.
Backend:

Powered by Node.js and Express.js, the backend server supports face detection using the ClariFai Face API.
Utilizes PostGreSQL for backend database storage.
Implements Knex for querying registered user details and validating user login credentials.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
